In 1814, the British acquired 51,700 km² of territory to the east of the Essequibo (all other Guyana) as a result of an agreement with the Netherlands, which did not establish the western border of the purchased colony. Therefore, colonial authorities appointed Robert Herman Schomburg, who worked for the Royal Geographical Society, responsible for defining the border. He conducted a botanical and geographical study of British Guyana, the result of which was the concept of a border that, according to Schomburg, corresponded to the boundaries of the lands claimed by the Dutch, and then the British. Britain officially recognized the Essequibo River as the border until gold was discovered in the Yuruari River basin. 17 years later, taking advantage of the confusion in the newly separated Gran Colombia Venezuela, in 1831 the English seized most of the modern region. In 1841 the government of José Antonio Paes condemned the British Empire's invasion of Venezuelan territory. Thus began the long 180-year territorial dispute over the territory of Guyana-Essequibo. In such a state, in which Great Britain unofficially occupied most of the territory, this low-intensity conflict lasted more than 50 years, when at the request of Venezuela the United States intervened in the conflict through the Monroe Doctrine in 1865. As a result, in 1899, the \"Schomburg Line,\" with slight deviations in favor of Venezuela (Britain retained all gold mines), was recognized by the international Paris arbitration group as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela (in the middle of the 20th century there were disputes that the British bribed a Russian judge who made decisions on the lawsuit)." },

The first oil began to be pumped in Guyana in 2019, and since then the economy of this tiny country has been booming - for three consecutive years it has grown by more than 40% per year." },

Maduro opposes the extraction of oil in the disputed region by foreign companies, while the Guyanese authorities have granted the right to extract oil to a number of companies from the USA, Qatar, the UK, France, China, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia.<br> In connection with this, in conditions of relative hopelessness of further attempts to settle the issue through international mediators, the Venezuelan authorities began to take unilateral actions. The most noticeable of these was the decision of the Venezuelan National Assembly to hold a consultative referendum on Venezuela's right to the disputed territory of Essequibo.<br> The referendum held on December 3 contained 5 questions concerning support or rejection of compliance with the decisions of the Paris Arbitration and Geneva Agreement, non-recognition of the jurisdiction of the UN International Court, and the most key - the opinion of the Venezuelan people about the government's plan to create a state of Guyana-Essequibo with immediate provision of Venezuelan citizenship to its population.<br> " },

They quickly broke through the border guards' defences, moving more than 5 km deep into the frontline on the first day. Over the next few days, encountering only a small force of mostly conscripts (which also explains the relatively large number of Russian military personnel taken at the beginning of the offensive), the Ukrainian troops advanced 10-15 kilometres a day. Thus, as early as 8 August morning, a Ukrainian tank was reported in the village of Ivnytsia, halfway between Suja and Lgov, which is 37 km in a straight line to the Ukrainian border, or 45 km by road, and at a petrol station at the entrance to Korenevo (20 km to the border)." },

While one-third of the group was fighting a Russian Armed Forces stronghold, the other part was moving further along the road, shooting at Russian reinforcements on the way. Thus, the combat-restrained soldiers reported on the enemy's ‘large-scale offensive’ while others saw AFU equipment in literally every village, although they were the same DRGs visiting village after village. As a result, such tactics allow the AFU to achieve the main task - panic and exit to the operational space where there are no Russian defence positions. The situation was also affected by the Ukrainian electronic warfare units, which, in addition to fighting against FPV drones, also blocked mobile communications, making communication between the Russian army forces, which exchange information using mobile devices, very difficult." },

Yesterday, 14 August, the Ukrainian armed forces opened another point of entry across the Russian border 8 km to the left of the main direction, advancing 5 km inland and reaching the village of Vneszapnoye. A little earlier, on the night of 9-10 August, another direction was also opened, 12 km to the east of the nearest occupied village, where a 12 km breakthrough was made overnight to the village of Giryi. Globally, the last few days have been characterised by the gradual occupation by the Ukrainian armed forces of new settlements on a wide front, already on a more permanent basis by regular troops. At the moment, it seems that without the arrival of substantial reinforcements for the Russian forces, this trend may continue for quite some time." },

        { "type": "text", "value": "But such a goal can hardly be considered strategic. Because, sooner or later, it is obvious that Russian troops will be able to accumulate enough forces to stop the offensive of the AFU, and the transition to a potential counter-offensive operation. And then the AFU will have to use its reserves to prevent the loss of acquired positions, or even the transition of the combat zone to its own territory. After all, nothing will be able to stop the already formed group from deciding to move on, if they can push the Ukrainian troops back to the border."},

        { "type": "text", "value": "Another military goal could be the creation of a so-called buffer zone (similar to the goals of the Russian Armed Forces' offensive on Kharkiv Oblast) to ease the pressure of enemy shelling on the border territories. But it cannot strategically justify such a dangerous operation either, for essentially the same reasons as the pullback of forces. Artiukh, head of the OVA in Sumy region, recently reported that the intensity of shelling has increased ‘dozens of times’. More than 100 guided aerial bombs were dropped over the last two days, while in the past 7 months - 750. This fact proves that without achieving a significant breakthrough of at least 50-60 kilometres in all directions, this operation will only bring harm to this target."},

        { "type": "text", "value": "Another common interpretation of this offensive, linked to the idea that the negotiations are no longer for the Gormai and everything is heading towards them, is that the captured territory will be added to the so-called ‘exchange fund’ in order to exchange it for parts of Kharkiv and other regions in the future. Naturally, in order to implement this strategy, the AFU will have to hold this territory until the end of the negotiations, and suppress all attempts to return it, which will require considerable effort and resources. Such a strategy is fraught with high risks, as success will depend not only on military action, but also on the political will of both sides to negotiate and compromise, which, according to another explanation, this offensive has only alienated."},

Located only 60 kilometres from the Ukrainian border and 35km from the nearest point where Ukrainian troops have been spotted (40km to the point of absolute control) in the city of Kurchatov, control over it would give Ukraine the opportunity to ‘trade’ it for, for example, the Zaporozhye NPP, or blackmail it.

        { "type": "text", "value": "Regardless, if this strategy actually works and can convince even sceptics like Trump that defeating Russia is not a dream, but a more than realistic goal.

This gives the supporters of the ‘war to the victorious end’ in Ukraine and in the West an excuse to say - ‘Putin does not control the situation, even among the Z-bloggers and their handlers from the “Kremlin towers” he cannot restore order, and therefore confusion and a new rebellion are inevitable’."},

The offensive of the AFU in the Kursk region can be stopped in time, the Kremlin (including Z-publics) can quickly take the information space under the tightest possible control.

However, if, as Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst with the Polish security group Rochan Consulting, has written, ‘Ukrainian forces will be pushed back from Russian territory without any tangible results with heavy losses’ and Russian forces continue to approach Pokrovsk at the current pace, Ukraine will probably be considered to have lost a costly military adventure."}
