In 1814, the British acquired 51,700 km² of territory to the east of the Essequibo (all other Guyana) as a result of an agreement with the Netherlands, which did not establish the western border of the purchased colony. Therefore, colonial authorities appointed Robert Herman Schomburg, who worked for the Royal Geographical Society, responsible for defining the border. He conducted a botanical and geographical study of British Guyana, the result of which was the concept of a border that, according to Schomburg, corresponded to the boundaries of the lands claimed by the Dutch, and then the British. Britain officially recognized the Essequibo River as the border until gold was discovered in the Yuruari River basin. 17 years later, taking advantage of the confusion in the newly separated Gran Colombia Venezuela, in 1831 the English seized most of the modern region. In 1841 the government of José Antonio Paes condemned the British Empire's invasion of Venezuelan territory. Thus began the long 180-year territorial dispute over the territory of Guyana-Essequibo. In such a state, in which Great Britain unofficially occupied most of the territory, this low-intensity conflict lasted more than 50 years, when at the request of Venezuela the United States intervened in the conflict through the Monroe Doctrine in 1865. As a result, in 1899, the \"Schomburg Line,\" with slight deviations in favor of Venezuela (Britain retained all gold mines), was recognized by the international Paris arbitration group as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela (in the middle of the 20th century there were disputes that the British bribed a Russian judge who made decisions on the lawsuit)." },

The first oil began to be pumped in Guyana in 2019, and since then the economy of this tiny country has been booming - for three consecutive years it has grown by more than 40% per year." },

Maduro opposes the extraction of oil in the disputed region by foreign companies, while the Guyanese authorities have granted the right to extract oil to a number of companies from the USA, Qatar, the UK, France, China, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia.<br> In connection with this, in conditions of relative hopelessness of further attempts to settle the issue through international mediators, the Venezuelan authorities began to take unilateral actions. The most noticeable of these was the decision of the Venezuelan National Assembly to hold a consultative referendum on Venezuela's right to the disputed territory of Essequibo.<br> The referendum held on December 3 contained 5 questions concerning support or rejection of compliance with the decisions of the Paris Arbitration and Geneva Agreement, non-recognition of the jurisdiction of the UN International Court, and the most key - the opinion of the Venezuelan people about the government's plan to create a state of Guyana-Essequibo with immediate provision of Venezuelan citizenship to its population.<br> " },

The main reforms since coming to power have been the reform of the judiciary and a number of anti-corruption laws.

In fact, the opposition went to the polls in fragmented columns, occasionally competing with each other. In addition, most of the opposition has a much higher anti-rating than Sandu. And that is why, also taking into account the results of the polls, the last months before the elections the question was not whether the current president would win at all, it's whether Sandu wins the first round or will need a second round." },

The consequences of the second round are easy to underestimate. Firstly, there is a very small chance that because of her pro-Western stance, she will lose the second round due to the consolidation of neutral or pro-Russian votes around Stoianoglo. Second, because of the same consolidation, a diverse opposition may choose to form a unified coalition of anti-European parties, which would significantly increase the chances of success. This would create a risk that undecided voters who previously supported different opposition parties could rally around a single candidate who would represent more moderate or pro-Russian sentiments." },

And if the opposition will have a single candidate, or even worse, a coalition of parties that will go to the elections as a single entity, these chances are reduced almost to a minimum. All the more so because the popular mayor of Chisinau, former socialist Ion Ciaban, is also in the ‘reserve’. Although he is not running in the presidential elections, it is likely that he will take part in the parliamentary elections. This could lead to him collecting a significant number of votes, including taking them away from the presidential party PAS." },

Sandu was absolutely sure of its positive outcome, and it was only intended to consolidate the people's decision in the constitution, similar to the referendum that took place in Ukraine before Petro Poroshenko left power. She also probably wanted to use it as one of the main arguments of her campaign for the parliamentary elections and beyond. That is, from Sandus perspective, since the majority of the population voted in favour of European integration, and I and my party are the main representatives of this idea, you should vote for me. This can be seen from her words at the press conference in spring:" },

According to the results of the vote count, the supporters of European integration are ahead of the opponents by less than 0.8 per cent. This margin emerged only after the last few per cent of the protocols were processed - before that, the EU opponents were in the lead. The margin in favour of European integration was achieved mainly due to the votes of the diaspora, where 75% voted in favour and which counted last, while the majority of Moldovans voted against. For comparison, the highest proportion of those who voted in one of the Moldovan regions is 67.7%(next 62%), while in the capital Chisinau only 55.9% voted in favour. In autonomous Gagauzia, in fact, almost 95% of voters were against it. In any case, such an insignificant margin between the ‘for’ and ‘against’ votes puts into question the legitimacy of the referendum itself and, in fact, does not allow us to say that the people expressed their support for a certain course. In addition, it is difficult to perceive the results as a vote of confidence in Sandu. Rather, it can be seen as a failure and a sign of public disappointment with her policies." },

It is enough just to look at the frequency of visits to Moldova by Western officials to the Moldovan capital during the last month before the elections. Thus, just 5 days before the vote, 8 foreign ministers from the Nordic-Baltic G8 [visited](https://radiomoldova.md/p/41425/eight-foreign-ministers-from-the-nordic-baltic-eight-on-a-visit-to-chisinau) the republic, signing a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ with Moldova. This was a good reinforcement of the recent [visit](https://www.infotag.md/m9_economics/319452/) of the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. At that time she announced the largest EU aid package of 1.8 billion euros (10 per cent of the country's GDP) for the next three years, which will allow, in Sandu's words, to «build a strong economy»." },

With a gap of more than 20%, it is hard to imagine that Stoianoglo could overtake Sandu in the second round, but it is theoretically possible. To understand where the remaining 31.5% of votes will go, we can make an analogy with the previous presidential elections, which took place in 2020. Back then, instead of Stoianoglo, PSRM was represented by Igor Dodon, who was only 3.5% behind Sandu in the first round. Third place went to Renato Usatii, the former mayor of the large city of Balti - who, although he claims to support Moldova's full neutrality, is in fact [is](https://www.rferl.org/a/moldova-elections-east-or-west/26713779.html) and is perceived by the population as slightly pro-Russian. Violeta Ivanov, a representative of the radically pro-Russian party Shor, which was banned last year, came 4th. As can be seen from the results of the second round, despite Sandu being the only pro-European candidate, the gap between Sandu and Dodon increased 4 times, reaching 4%. From this we can conclude that despite the great importance of the candidate's foreign policy orientation, the fact that Sandu was able to present herself as a candidate who cares about the welfare of citizens and fights corruption ensured her victory in the last elections, and although Moldovan voters are concerned about foreign policy issues, they were primarily worried about the internal problems of the country, which probably will not change this time." },

While it is hard to imagine if Stoiangolo could win the election and reverse its pro-Western course by deciding to strengthen its economic ties with Russia, it is not clear how he could achieve this. Being completely squeezed between Ukraine and Romania, two countries vastly superior in population, economy and military power, and with the separatist state of Transnistria hosting several thousand Russian soldiers, it is clear that no one is going to just let Moldova go wherever it wants to go. The substantial attention shown on both sides to the geopolitical course of the country only proves it. Whatever choice the Moldovan people make, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to implement this course without the approval of the neighbours." },

        { "type": "text", "value": "From a broader perspective, the outcome of the recent vote in Moldova demonstrates a strong decline in the societies of post-Soviet countries in the attractiveness of integration with the EU, which used to be perceived as a great prize. Moldova is only one example. There is also Georgia, whose authorities are in a standoff with the Eurostructures, and which will hold important parliamentary elections next Sunday."},

        { "type": "text", "value": "In both cases, undeniably, the developments are also significantly influenced by Russia, which acts through local politicians. Such political manoeuvres by Moscow prove to be more effective in correcting the course of post-Soviet countries than military intervention, as in the case of Ukraine, which only pushed it as far away from Russia as possible."},

The results of the elections and especially the referendum, which showed such a small margin of support for European integration, indicate a deep polarisation of society. Now, in order to maintain their pro-Western orientation, the authorities will have to seek compromises with those who oppose it, or prepare for the risks of instability and pressure from both pro-Russian and pro-European forces. The next parliamentary elections could be even more significant than the presidential elections, as the outcome will determine whether Sandu's supporters can consolidate their grip on power or whether the pro-Russian opposition will find ways to take the initiative. Regardless of the outcome, societal tensions and the influence of external actors on domestic politics are likely to remain among the key factors shaping Moldova's future in the coming years."}

        { "type": "text", "value": "As of the evening of 15 August, the front line is still not completely stabilized. Yesterday, 14 August, the Ukrainian armed forces opened another point of entry across the Russian border 8 km to the left of the main direction, advancing 5 km inland and reaching the village of Vneszapnoye. A little earlier, on the night of 9-10 August, another direction was also opened, 12 km to the east of the nearest occupied village, where a 12 km breakthrough was made overnight to the village of Giryi. Globally, the last few days have been characterised by the gradual occupation by the Ukrainian armed forces of new settlements on a wide front, already on a more permanent basis by regular troops. At the moment, it seems that without the arrival of substantial reinforcements for the Russian forces, this trend may continue for quite some time." },

The Ukrainian army and military blogs hardly commented on the situation. For example, the Ukrainian military telegram channel Deep State described and showed on a map what was happening on the first day of the attack on the Kursk region only on 9 August. And the first official mention of the events in Kursk was made only on 10 August, in Zelensky's evening address, where he said that today several times Chief Syrsky had already reported «on the displacement of the war into the territory of the aggressor»."},

To show that Ukraine can attack, to raise morale in Ukrainian society and among Western partners (whose support is critical for Ukraine), while in Russian society, on the contrary, to undermine the belief in victory in this war among the population, at the same time causing discord among Russian elites and in the information space (which is very much facilitated by various z-publics for two weeks already stirring up ‘betrayal’).)." },

First of all, the scale. If then we were talking about no more than 20-30 people DRG (and then the main task was really media), now we are talking about at least 1000 Ukrainian soldiers, already deep in the territory of the Russian Federation " },

        { "type": "text", "value": "One of the goals of the Kursk operation, apart from the media one, is often referred to as forcing the Russian army to transfer some of its forces from the Donbass direction (where the AFU has been doing really badly lately). Thus weakening the enemy's onslaught in the most difficult areas."},
        { "type": "text", "value": "But such a goal can hardly be considered strategic. Because, sooner or later, it is obvious that Russian troops will be able to accumulate enough forces to stop the offensive of the AFU, and the transition to a potential counter-offensive operation. And then the AFU will have to use its reserves to prevent the loss of acquired positions, or even the transition of the combat zone to its own territory. After all, nothing will be able to stop the already formed group from deciding to move on, if they can push the Ukrainian troops back to the border."},

But it cannot strategically justify such a dangerous operation either, for essentially the same reasons as the pullback of forces. Artiukh, head of the OVA in Sumy region, recently reported that the intensity of shelling has increased ‘dozens of times’. More than 100 guided aerial bombs were dropped over the last two days, while in the past 7 months - 750. This fact proves that without achieving a significant breakthrough of at least 50-60 kilometres in all directions, this operation will only bring harm to this target."},

        { "type": "text", "value": "Another common interpretation of this offensive, linked to the idea that the negotiations are no longer for the Gormai and everything is heading towards them, is that the captured territory will be added to the so-called ‘exchange fund’ in order to exchange it for parts of Kharkiv and other regions in the future. Naturally, in order to implement this strategy, the AFU will have to hold this territory until the end of the negotiations, and suppress all attempts to return it, which will require considerable effort and resources. Such a strategy is fraught with high risks, as success will depend not only on military action, but also on the political will of both sides to negotiate and compromise, which, according to another explanation, this offensive has only alienated."},

Located only 60 kilometres from the Ukrainian border and 35km from the nearest point where Ukrainian troops have been spotted (40km to the point of absolute control) in the city of Kurchatov, control over it would give Ukraine the opportunity to ‘trade’ it for, for example, the Zaporozhye NPP, or blackmail it. For example, Kiev could claim that it could blow up the power plant if Russia uses nuclear weapons (although this is unlikely to happen)."},

In addition to Ukrainian actions, Russian z-publics, which have created panic, hysteria and chaos in the Russian Federation's information space by spreading ‘zrada. This gives the supporters of the ‘war to the victorious end’ in Ukraine and in the West an excuse to say - ‘Putin does not control the situation, even among the Z-bloggers and their handlers from the “Kremlin towers” he cannot restore order, and therefore confusion and a new rebellion are inevitable’."},

        { "type": "text", "value": "Obviously, all these calculations may turn out to be wrong (as well as calculations on the success of the offensive and turmoil in the Russian Federation in 2023). The offensive of the AFU in the Kursk region can be stopped in time, the Kremlin (including Z-publics) can quickly take the information space under the tightest possible control. And Ukraine will end up with a simply extended front, which will require large reserves to hold, while the Russian army's offensive in eastern Ukraine will continue."},

While some see this gesture as an aggressive preparation for negotiations, aiming to strengthen their future negotiating positions, others think that this is just the beginning of a new stage of escalation.

Ukraine has taken a huge risk by depriving the tired eastern front of much-needed reserves, where, as an AFU officer writes, ‘everything is very sad, no exaggeration. Perhaps if Ukraine manages to divert resources from Donetsk Oblast and if Ukraine itself can gain a foothold in Kursk Oblast, the AFU operation could be called a success. However, if, as Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst with the Polish security group Rochan Consulting, has written, ‘Ukrainian forces will be pushed back from Russian territory without any tangible results with heavy losses’ and Russian forces continue to approach Pokrovsk at the current pace, Ukraine will probably be considered to have lost a costly military adventure."}
